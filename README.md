## Overview

The Counter App consists of a single HTML file, a stylesheet (CSS), and a JavaScript file. The application's UI features a counter display and three buttons: "Subtract," "Reset," and "Add." Users can interact with these buttons to manipulate the counter's value.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/counter-app.git
   ```

2. Open the cloned folder in your preferred code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the Counter App.

4. You will see a counter displayed on the page with the current value of 0. You can use the following buttons:

   - "Subtract": Decreases the counter value by 1.
   - "Reset": Resets the counter value to 0.
   - "Add": Increases the counter value by 1.

## File Structure

The project's file structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the appearance of the Counter App.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the functionality of the app.

## Technologies Used

The Counter App is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: Programming language used to add interactivity and functionality.

The app also utilizes the Font Awesome icon library for displaying icons on the buttons.
